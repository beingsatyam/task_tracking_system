# Event Management System

## Overview

This is a simple event management system built using Node.js with Sequelize ORM and SQLite as the database. The application allows users to create, update, delete, and register for events. Admin users have the ability to perform CRUD operations on events, while regular users can register for events. Additionally, a notification email is sent to users upon successful registration.

## Features

- **User Management**: Register, login, and manage users with different roles (admin and regular users).
- **Event Management**: Admin users can create, update, and delete events.
- **Event Registration**: Regular users can register for events, and a notification email is sent to them upon successful registration.
- **Authentication**: Users authenticate using email and password with token-based sessions.
- **Email Notification**: An email is sent upon successful registration, event update, and event deletion.
